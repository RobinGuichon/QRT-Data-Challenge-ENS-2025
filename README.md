## 📋 Project Overview
*Challenge organized by the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) and Qube Research & Technologies (QRT).*

The objective of this project is to predict the **overall survival** of patients with **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**. The dataset is complex, multimodal (clinical data, genomic mutations, cytogenetic reports), and subject to **right-censorship** (survival time is unknown for surviving patients).

This repository contains the full pipeline, from raw data processing to the final Stacked Generalization model.
